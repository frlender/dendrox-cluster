# DendroX Cluster
This standalone program provides a graphic user interface to generate JSON and image inputs to the [DendroX](https://github.com/frlender/DendroX) app. The input to this program is a delimited text file that contains a numeric matrix with row and column labels. An example input file can be found [here](https://github.com/frlender/denrox-cluster/tree/main/example_input).

**Please download the Windows or Mac executable using the following links:**
\
[Windows version](https://github.com/frlender/denrox-cluster/raw/main/dist/DendroX_Cluster.exe)
\
[MAC version](https://github.com/frlender/denrox-cluster/raw/main/dist/DendroX_Cluster.zip)  (Please unzip it first)

Note 1: When clicking  on the Mac executable for the first time, the OS would probably block its running. Please click "System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Open Anyway" to give permission.

Note 2: Currently, the Mac executable takes about **1~2 minutes** to start. I am actively looking for ways to reduce the time.

After click on the executable, a black terminal will show before the following user interface appears:
